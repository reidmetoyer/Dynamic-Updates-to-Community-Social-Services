Please use the provided pdf file and return a string in the structure of a python dictionary of information from the page. Information to look for includes phone number, email, address, any social media handles, and if applicable, what hours the organization is open. For instance a sample dictionary would look like this: {phone: 111-111-1111, email: happy@gmail.com, address: 2000 White Dragon Ave, New York City, NY 10027, facebook: facebook.com/stmargaretshouse1, open-hours: 10am-4pm}. Return this dictionary as a string, NOT a code block. Do not include any other text in the response other than the dictionary.
